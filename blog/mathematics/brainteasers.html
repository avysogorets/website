            car with a light off; assume this happens \(M\) cars down, (2) turn the light in that car on and return to the original car, (3) if the light is still off, continue to step (1). Otherwise, the last car you visited must be the first car; return \(M\). <span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                    (50%). There are two solutions that, in my opinion, deserve discussion: one more formal but rather dull, and the other more clever but somewhat speculative.
                    For the first one, consider a more general problem with \(n\) passengers on a fully-booked plane with \(n\) seats. Denote the probability that the last passenger \(P_{n}\) occupies his assigned seat by \(p(n)\); the original problem asks for \(p(100)\).
                    To start, note that \(p(2) = 50\%\). Now, let's find a recurrence relation for \(p(n)\). If the first passenger \(P_1\) takes his assigned seat, everything falls into order, and \(P_n\) gets his seat too. Otherwise, assume \(P_1\) takes a seat assigned to \(P_m\) where \(1 < m < n \). Then, passengers \(P_2, P_3, \ldots, P_{m-1}\) will all get their seats, but \(P_m\) will have to choose one at random. His options are the seat of \(P_1\) union all seats that belong to passengers \(P_{m+1}, \ldots, P_{n}\). This scenario corresponds to the same original problem with \(n-m+1\) total seats (where \(P_{m}\) choosing the seat of \(P_1\) corresponds to taking "the right" seat so that all others get their assigned seats thereafter, including \(P_n\)). Since \(P_1\) chooses a seat uniformly at random, we can write a recurrence relation
                    \[p(n) = \frac{1}{n}\left(2 + \sum_{m=2}^{n-2}{p(n-m+1)}\right)\]
                    where \(2 = 1 + 1\) comes from \(m=1\) (\(P_1\) takes his own seat) and \(m=n-1\) (\(P_n\) is guaranteed his seat). Assuming that \(p(k)=50\%\), for all \(1 < k < n\) as an induction hypothesis, we compute \(p(n) = \frac{1}{n}(50\%\cdot(n-4) + 2) = 50\%\).<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>
                    <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;"/>
                    A more elegant approach is to reformulate the boarding procedure in an equivalent but more intuitive way. As likely to happen in real life, assume passengers \(P_2, P_3, \ldots, P_{n-1}\) each occupy their assigned seats and, in case it is already taken, kindly ask the squatter to move. While this will result in a different arrangement than in the original problem, it clearly does not affect the odds of the last passenger getting the correct seat. In this scenario, all passengers \(P_2\) through \(P_{n-1}\) sit in the right places while \(P_1\) is getting moved across the cabin unless he settles for his own seat or the seat of \(P_n\). Each time someone kicks him out, \(P_1\) is equally likely to move to either of these two seats, so the probability that either of these two seats is available by the time \(P_n\) arrives should be the same by symmetry. Finally, note that these two seats are the only ones that can potentially remain unoccupied when \(P_n\) boards the flight.<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                One obvious solution is the South pole; but there's more, infinitely many more. The other solutions are in the vicinity of the North pole so that moving 10 miles East comprises a full circle (or multiple circles) around the Earth.  For this to happen, the original starting point should be 10 miles South of one of such concentric circles, so we first move up, make one or more loops (10 miles) around the North pole, and come back down.
                Thus, the full solution is the South pole union a countable collection of
                concentric circles around the North pole.<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                Since the ratio of their speeds is \(4\), the angular velocity of the prisoner is larger than the angular velocity of the guard provided that the prisoner stays within the circle of radius \(R/4\). It then follows that he can eventually get to be opposite to the guard on that circle (see the picture).
                When this happens, the prisoner needs to smiw \(\frac{3R}{4}\) to the nearest point on the ground whereas the guard must cover \(\pi R\) to get there. Therefore, the prisoner will be able to escape. <span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                One naive linear-time and linear-space solution would be to use a hash table to store the number of times each ID appears in the logs and then traverse all its key-value pairs to find the one unmatched ID. However, due to the constant-space constraint, we can't use a hash table. In fact, this constraint makes it clear that data structures are useless here, and instead, we should come up with a clever <it>operation</it> to apply to the IDs as we traverse the logs. Ideally, this operation should be commutative (so the order of logs does not matter) and, most importantly, nilpotent of order 2 (so the second appearance of the same ID cancels out with the first). One such function is a bitwise OR. Provided that all IDs come in pairs except for one that appears only once, this ID equals the bitwise OR of all IDs in the logs.<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                Let's factor the direction of the jumps into \(s\) by allowing it to be negative. Then, at any time \(t\), the position of the rabbit is \(p(t)=a+st\), so knowing both \(a\) and \(s\) is sufficient to catch the rabbit.
                Therefore, we just need to come up with a strategy to identify \((a,s)\), which we can do iteratively starting with \((0,0)\) and progressing away from the origin in the \((a,s)\)-space. One such strategy is shown on the

                The best motivation to read through the solution is to know the final answer: it is the number \(e\). We start by writing out the definition of expectation. Let \(X_i\sim\text{Unif}(0,1)\), then
                \[\begin{align}\mathbb{E}(\text{number of drinks to sleep}) &= \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}n\mathbb{P}(\text{the critical drink is } X_{n}) = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}n\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i<1, \sum_{i=1}^nX_i\geq 1\right)\\
                &=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}n\left[\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i<1\right)-\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i<1\right)\right]=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i<1\right).\end{align}\] Above we first used the fact
                that events \(\{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i<1, \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\geq 1\}\) and \(\{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i<1\}\) are disjoint and their union is \(\{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i\}\), and then noticed that the resulting series is telescopic. Now, we find the
                required probabilities via iterated integration: \[\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i<1\right)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1-x_1}\ldots\int_{0}^{1-\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}x_i}\int_{0}^{1-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}x_i}dx_n\ldots dx_1=\int_{\Delta_n}dx_1\ldots dx_n\]
                where we noted that this expression computes the volume of a \(n\)-dimensional simplex \(\Delta_n\). A few low dimensional examples can give the right intuition. For \(n=2\), \(\mathbb{P}(X_1+X_2<1)\) is the volume (area) of \(\Delta_2\)&mdash;a triangle with vertices \(\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)\}\), so \(\mathbb{P}(X_1+X_2<1) = 1/2\). Likewise, \(\mathbb{P}(X_1+X_2+X_3<1) = \text{Vol}(\Delta_3) = 1/6\) as the volume of a tetrahedron.
                In fact, induction shows that \(\text{Vol}(\Delta_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\). Plugging this back into our series gives \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=e\).<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                The informal language of the question hints towards a geometric argument. By visualizing the joint probability density function of two independent standard Gaussians and adding a linear constraint of \(x_2 = 1-x_1\), we can see that \((0.5,0.5)\) is a reasonable estimate
                for \((x_1,x_2\)) because it has the largest value of the PDF among all points on the line. That is, we just found the mode of a conditional distribution \((X_1,X_2)|S=1\).<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                Let \(Y_i\) (for \(i\in[N]\)) be an indicator variable indicating that the \(i\)-th object does not appear in the sample, and \(Y\) be the number of objects that do not appear in the sample, so \(X=N-Y\) and \(Y=\sum_{i=1}^NY_i\). By linearity of expectation, \[\mathbb{E}X=N-\sum_{i=1}^N\mathbb{E}Y_i=N-\sum_{i=1}^N\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1)=N-N(1-\frac{1}{N})^k\] since \(\mathbb{E}Y_i=(1-\frac{1}{N})^k\). Hence, \(\mathbb{E}X=N-N(1-\frac{1}{N})^k\). Note that when \(k=N\rightarrow\infty\), the proportion of unique objects in the sample is \(\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left[1-(1-\frac{1}{N})^N\right]=1-\frac{1}{e}\approx 63\%\). <span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                In this problem, we need to find the expected number (count) of some events. These types of problems can often be solved by defining indicator random variables for these simpler events and then using linearity of expectation to find the final answer. For this problem, we let \(X_i\) be the indicator variable with \(X_i = 1\) if the \(i\)-th drawn ball yields a color change (i.e., the \((i-1)\)-st ball is of the opposite color). 
                Then, we are interested in \(\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{m+n}X_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{m+n}\mathbb{E}X_i\) while \(\mathbb{E}X_i = \mathbb{P}X_i\). Thus, we just need to find the probability that the \(i\)-th drawn ball yields a color change. Intuitively, it should be equally likely to encounter a color change at any position \(i>1\). To make it more rigorous, enumerate all balls in the jar and consider the space of all permutations \(S_{m+n}\). For any pair of balls, there is the same number of permutations
                with these balls at position \((1,2)\) and at position \((i-1,i)\). Thus, \(\mathbb{P}(X_i) = \mathbb{P}(X_2) = \frac{2mn}{(m+n)(m+n-1)}.\) Hence, the expected number of color changes is \(\frac{2mn}{m+n}.\) <span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

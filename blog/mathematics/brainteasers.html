                One naive linear-time and linear-space solution would be to use a hash table to store the number of times each ID appears in the logs and then traverse all its key-value pairs to find the one unmatched ID. However, due to the constant-space constraint, we can't use a hash table. In fact, this constraint makes it clear that data structures are useless here, and instead, we should come up with a clever <it>operation</it> to apply to the IDs as we traverse the logs. Ideally, this operation should be commutative (so the order of logs does not matter) and, most importantly, nilpotent of order 2 (so the second appearance of the same ID cancels out with the first). One such function is a bitwise OR. Provided that all IDs come in pairs except for one that appears only once, this ID equals the bitwise OR of all IDs in the logs.<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                    (50%). There are two solutions that, in my opinion, deserve discussion: one more formal but rather dull, and the other more clever but somewhat speculative.
                    For the first one, consider a more general problem with \(n\) passengers on a fully-booked plane with \(n\) seats. Denote the probability that the last passenger \(P_{n}\) occupies his assigned seat by \(p(n)\); the original problem asks for \(p(100)\).
                    To start, note that \(p(2) = 50\%\). Now, let's find a recurrence relation for \(p(n)\). If the first passenger \(P_1\) takes his assigned seat, everything falls into order, and \(P_n\) gets his seat too. Otherwise, assume \(P_1\) takes a seat assigned to \(P_m\) where \(1 < m < n \). Then, passengers \(P_2, P_3, \ldots, P_{m-1}\) will all get their seats, but \(P_m\) will have to choose one at random. His options are the seat of \(P_1\) union all seats that belong to passengers \(P_{m+1}, \ldots, P_{n}\). This scenario corresponds to the same original problem with \(n-m+1\) total seats (where \(P_{m}\) choosing the seat of \(P_1\) corresponds to taking "the right" seat so that all others get their assigned seats thereafter, including \(P_n\)). Since \(P_1\) chooses a seat uniformly at random, we can write a recurrence relation
                    \[p(n) = \frac{1}{n}\left(2 + \sum_{m=2}^{n-2}{p(n-m+1)}\right)\]
                    where \(2 = 1 + 1\) comes from \(m=1\) (\(P_1\) takes his own seat) and \(m=n-1\) (\(P_n\) is guaranteed his seat). Assuming that \(p(k)=50\%\), for all \(1 < k < n\) as an induction hypothesis, we compute \(p(n) = \frac{1}{n}(50\%\cdot(n-4) + 2) = 50\%\).<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>
                    <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;"/>
                    A more elegant approach is to reformulate the boarding procedure in an equivalent but more intuitive way. As likely to happen in real life, assume passengers \(P_2, P_3, \ldots, P_{n-1}\) each occupy the assigned seat and, in case it is already taken, kindly ask the squatter to move. While this will result in a different arrangement than in the original problem, it clearly does not affect the odds of the last passenger getting the correct seat. In this scenario, all passengers \(P_2\) through \(P_{n-1}\) sit in the right places while \(P_1\) is getting moved across the cabin unless he settles for his own seat or the seat of \(P_n\). Each time someone kicks him out, \(P_1\) is equally likely to move to either of these two seats, so the probability that either of these two seats is available by the time \(P_n\) arrives should be the same by symmetry. Finally, note that these two seats are the only ones that can potentially remain unoccupied when \(P_n\) boards the flight.<span style="float:right"><i class='bx bx-square'></i></span>

                are now in the same traffic group (note that a single car following no other car and having no cars immediately behind it forms one traffic group). After some finite time,
                this system reaches the limiting state where all potential traffic groups have been formed; denote this number of traffic groups by a random variable \(X\). Find \(\mathbb{E}X\).

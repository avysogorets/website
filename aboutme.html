            </div>
            <div class="small-text" style="--c:rgb(88, 88, 88);--d:0"> 
                I was born and raised in Moscow, Russia. In 2015, when I was 18, I graduated from the state lyceum "The Second School"
                and moved to the U.S. to study mathematics
                at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In the summers of 2018 and 2019, I participated in research programs
                for undergraduates at San Diego State University and in IPAM at UCLA, which influenced my decision to continue my education in machine learning.
                After graduating in 2019, I moved to New York and started as a Ph.D. student
                at the Center for Data Science at NYU. I received U.S. citizenship in 2021.

                I used to take tennis classes when I was a kid and, like many others,
                I am trying to get back to it after many years. I am a professional tennis fan though;
                the peak of my career is the semifinals of Miami Open 2023 where I (almost) caught the ball hit by Daniil Medvedev.
                Fun fact: Daniil and I attended the same high school in Moscow in 2010-2011!<br><br>

                I am very enthusiastic about Preferans&mdash;a fascinating card game that originated in Russia
                in the 18-th century. Some people say that Preferans is an easier version of Bridge but I can neither
                confirm nor deny this statement because I don't play Bridge. My lifelong dream is to go on a week-long train trip across Siberia 
                and play Preferans with my friends all along.<br><br>

                I occasionally play the guitar. It's very relaxing, although I easily get frustrated when it doesn't come out right.
                Some of my favourite songs are written by Boris Grebenshikov, Yuri Shevchuk, and Leonid Fedorov.

            <div class="small-text" style="--c:rgb(88, 88, 88);--d:0; margin-bottom: 45px;"> 
                I expect to graduate with a Ph.D. degree in Data Science in the summer of 2024. Having worked in various roles during my summer internships, I am inclined to pursue a career as a Quantitative Researcher in finance or consulting. I currently live in New York but am open to relocating after graduation.
